OSX 10.12 Sierra Setup

a) Make sure the nonsense gatekeeper is off. 
open terminal
sudo spctl --master-disable

b) install homebrew so we can install python 3 and related things.
http://brew.sh   <-- Webpage

Command:
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

c) update git
brew install git

d) install python 3 
(fine to install python 2 if you want, but system ships with it)
brew install python3

There are some python related things installed in /Applications
So we need to symlink them
brew linkapps python3

Brew will install pip when it installs python3 but we need to update
pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

e) install the good stuff:
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install scipy
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install jupyter
pip3 install scikit-learn
pip3 install pyserial

f) setup your git(hub) workflow(s)
I personally use a gui as much as I can (gasp!). Howevever, everything can be done from commandline.

f) install the arduino ide
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
Grab the latest OSX distribution unless warned otherwise

g) move the usb host library and the motor shield library to
~/Documents/Arduino/Libraries
You can't symlink which is stupid, but the way it is.
