Shaping Variables of Note

Each trial leads to target reward contigency, which are logged:
self.rewardContingency

code:
10: stim 1 selected, cue means left (0) spout is rewarded
11: stim 1 selected, cue means right (1) spout is rewarded
20: stim 2 selected, cue means left (0) spout is rewarded
21: stim 2 selected, cue means right (1) spout is rewarded

Each trial leads to a choice outcome, which are logged:
self.trialOutcome

code:
0 = timed out
1 = target choice -> normal reward
2 = off target choice -> punish
3 = ambiguous (chose both) -> punish

all are preceded by a 1 or a 2 for stim 1 or stim 2, so 10 is timed out for a stim 1 trial

The choice comparitors are:
self.minStimTime: the amount of time you won't believe a choice
self.minTargetLicks: the number of licks you require for a true report
self.maxOffTargetLicks: the number of licks you will tollerate for an offtarget report
self.minOffTargetLicks: the number of licks the animal needs to be off target to beleive choice is bad
self.reportMaxTime: this is a timeout for the choice
